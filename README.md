# Project-Portfolio-Repo
This repository includes code and reports from projects completed during my time in MIDS. Original repositories are private. Code completed by me has been included in this public repository.

- **Flight Delay Prediction**  
  Built a scalable ML pipeline in Databricks to predict U.S. flight delays. After feature engineering, achieved 61% recall on the “Delay” class with logistic regression, outperforming boosting and neural networks. Focused on reducing airline costs and improving customer satisfaction.

- **Investment Diversification App (Quantari)**  
  Developed a web application using clustering and graph theory to identify undervalued but high-performing stocks. Designed to help investors visualize diversification and optimize portfolio allocation.

- **Wage Prediction & Income Inequality Analysis**  
  Applied regression and ensemble models with demographic and economic features to predict wages (R² = 0.91). Aimed at identifying key drivers of income inequality through feature importance and model interpretation.
